//1. Create a variable called age and assign it a number (e.g., 25).
let age = 25;

//2. Create a variable called name and assign it a string (e.g., "John").
const name = "John";

//3. Create a variable called isStudent and assign it a boolean value (true or false).
const isStudent = true;

//4. Create a variable called hobbies and assign it an array with a few strings (e.g., ["reading", "coding", "running"]).
const hobbies = ["reading", "coding", "running"];

//5. Create an object called info with two properties:
//schoolName (a string, e.g., "Business College Helsinki")
//groupName (a number, e.g., REACT25K)
const info = {
  schoolName: "Business College Helsinki",
  groupName: 25,
};

//6. Use console.log() to print each variable to the console.
console.log(age);
console.log(name);
console.log(isStudent);
console.log(hobbies);
console.log(info);

//7. Use the typeof operator to check and print the data type of each variable.
console.log(typeof age);
console.log(typeof name);
console.log(typeof isStudent);
console.log(typeof hobbies);
console.log(typeof info);
